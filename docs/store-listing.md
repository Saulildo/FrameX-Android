## Full Description

```
FrameX is a lightweight performance overlay for Android that displays real-time system metrics on top of games and apps.

Built for gamers, developers, and power users, FrameX provides accurate frame rate data and deep GPU/system telemetry on rooted devices, including a full replica of the Metal Performance HUD.

────────────────────────────

Key Features

• Real-time FPS monitoring
• Draggable overlay that works on top of any app
• CPU frequency monitoring
• RAM usage display
• Battery temperature tracking
• Network speed and ping measurement
• Customizable overlay appearance
• Multiple layout modes (Minimal, Compact, Expanded)

────────────────────────────

Accurate Frame Rate Monitoring

FrameX reads frame timing data using Android's compositor statistics (SurfaceFlinger timestats), the same source used by professional performance tools. This ensures precise frame rate reporting without interfering with game rendering.

────────────────────────────

Customizable Overlay

Choose how your overlay looks and behaves:

• Adjustable text size
• Opacity control
• Background color (Black, Navy, Charcoal, Transparent)
• Border style (Accent, Subtle, Ghost, None)
• Metric value color (White, Accent, Silver, Auto)
• Accent color selection
• Multiple display modes
• Drag and reposition anywhere on screen

All settings persist across restarts.

────────────────────────────

Powered by Root

FrameX uses a root (su) shell to access advanced system telemetry and to hook the Vulkan/OpenGL pipeline of the game you profile, enabling per-frame GPU, present, and encoder timings. A rooted device (Magisk / KernelSU) is required.

FrameX does not modify game behavior.

────────────────────────────

Privacy First

FrameX does not collect personal data.
No accounts. No analytics. No background tracking.

Internet permission is used only for optional ping measurement.

────────────────────────────

Requirements

• Android 8.0 (API 26) or higher
• Rooted device (Magisk / KernelSU)

FrameX is designed as a monitoring tool for performance insight and diagnostics. It does not boost, modify, or alter game performance.

## Safe / Conservative Description (use if policy team requests)

```
FrameX is a system monitoring overlay for Android that displays frame rate and device telemetry in real time.

It provides diagnostic visibility into device performance while running games or applications.

FrameX does not modify system behavior, adjust performance parameters, or alter any application functionality. It is strictly a monitoring utility.

## Review Strategy

First 50 reviews define early ranking.  
Ask beta testers to naturally mention:
- "FPS meter"
- stability
- accuracy

Do **not** incentivise reviews. Against Play policy.

## Versioning

- `v1.0.0` — initial release (current)
- Plan `v1.1.0` — Diagnostics panel, additional metrics
- Tag every release: `git tag -a v1.x.x -m "description" && git push --tags`
